        Under capitalism, science and engineering have been used to concentrate
        wealth in the hands of a small number of wealthy elites instead of
        serving the interests of the planet or its people.
      </p>
      <p>Itâ€™s time to change this.</p>

      <p>
        EngSciMath is a leftist community where individuals can socialize,
        provide and find academic support, and organize against capitalism. We
        are committed to building solidarity with all members of the working
        class, fostering inclusivity for marginalized and minority groups, and
        dedicating our technical skills to serving the the people.
