        We strive to think critically about how our science, math, and
        engineering skills are used in the world today and to understand the
        consequences of working under capitalism. We recognize the inherent
        limitations of todayâ€™s society, but where possible, we want encourage
        our members to make ethical choices with regard to the application of
        their skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        We aspire to provide a space where members can collaborate to develop
        class consciousness, fight back against alienation and oppression, and
        use their talents to build a better world.
